first prime p =  13
second prime q =  53
module n = p * q =  689
public exponent e =  685  ... is relative prim to p-1 and q-1
private exponent d =  133 ... corresponds to constraint (e*d)-1 is divisible by (p-1)*(q-1) without remainder
public key [n, e] =  [689, 685]
private key [n, d] =  [689, 133]
message m = 123
cipher = (m ** e) % n = 409
decipher = (cipher ** d) % n = 123
