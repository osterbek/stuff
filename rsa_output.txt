first prime p = 3
second prime q = 7
module n = p * q = 21
public exponent e = 5 ... is relative prim to p-1 and q-1
private exponent d = 17 ... corresponds to constraint (e*d)-1 is divisible by (p-1)*(q-1) without remainder
public key [n, e] = [21, 5]
private key [n, d] = [21, 17]
message m = 12
cipher = (m ** e) % n = 3
decipher = (cipher ** d) % n = 12
